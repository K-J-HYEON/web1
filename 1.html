  <h2>BENCH PRESS</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press" target="_blank" title="bench press">BENCH PRESS</a> is an upper-body weight training exercise
    in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench.
    The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles.

    <p>A barbell is generally used to hold the weight,
    but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.[1]
    The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and squat,
    and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively in weight training, bodybuilding,
    and other types of training to develop the chest muscles.</p>
