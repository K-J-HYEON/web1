  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)" target="_blank", title="squat">A squat</a> is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up.
    During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes;
    conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.
    Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength.

    <p>The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.[1]
    The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.[2]
    The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press.
    It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs.</p>
