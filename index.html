  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training" target = "_blank" title = "weight traing">WEIGHT TRAINING</a> is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.[2] It utilizes the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.

  <p>Sports in which weight training is used are: bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: American football, baseball, basketball, canoeing, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, boxing and wrestling.
  Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled and carefully defined. However, as with any form of exercise,
  improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury.
  If injured, full recovery is suggested before starting to weight train again or it will result in a bigger injury.</p>
